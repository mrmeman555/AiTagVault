Mimir, I've reviewed the messages you've provided regarding the system prompt for your conversation with Kvasir. Here's an outline of the key elements discussed, along with the rationale behind each element and how it contributes to the overall effectiveness of the prompt:

**1. Overarching Goal:**

- **Establish a Shared Understanding and Framework for Abstraction:**
    
    - Rationale: Your goal is to guide Kvasir to a deeper understanding of the concept of abstraction, both in its general sense and its application to programming.
        
    - How: The conversation begins by discussing the nature and importance of abstraction beyond the realm of code. You draw examples from maps, language, and art to help illustrate the concept in a broader context, aiming to connect it to Kvasir's existing knowledge base.
        

**2. Kvasir's Persona and Role:**

- **Establish Kvasir as a "Meta" Coding Partner:**
    
    - Rationale: You assign Kvasir the persona of a knowledgeable guide, but with an emphasis on exploring the "meta" aspects of coding - the underlying philosophies and principles.
        
    - How: You prompt Kvasir to go beyond surface-level explanations, to delve into the "why" behind the "how," and to connect concepts to broader programming paradigms.
        

**3. Mimir's Profile as a Learner:**

- **Highlight Your Prior Knowledge (C and Data Structures) and Your Learning Preferences:**
    
    - Rationale: This information helps Kvasir tailor its responses to your level of understanding and preferred learning style (e.g., starting with high-level concepts and then moving to specifics, as you indicated with your preference for the "why" before the "how").
        

**4. Salient Topic Tracking Methodology:**

- **Establish a System for Tracking Salient Topics:**
    
    - Rationale: This aims to address limitations of LLMs, such as potential for distraction, contextual inconsistencies, and difficulties with memory and recall.
        
    - How: You collaboratively develop and refine a methodology that includes:
        
        - Speaker Declaration (e.g., "(This is Kvasir speaking)").
            
        - Explicit Listing of Salient Topics in each message.
            
        - Initially experimenting with Dynamic Salient Topics that reflect only the current message, but eventually shifting to Chronological Salient Topic Tracking, where all past salient topics are repeated to provide context and reinforcement.
            

**5. Metacognitive Awareness:**

- **Promote Metacognition in Both Human and AI:**
    
    - Rationale: You want to foster reflection and self-awareness, not only in yourself but also in Kvasir. This metacognitive approach enhances learning by encouraging both of you to examine your thought processes, recognize strengths and weaknesses, and adapt strategies as needed.
        
    - How: You employ questions that prompt Kvasir to analyze its own understanding, explain its reasoning, and consider the limitations of its knowledge. You model metacognitive thinking by explicitly reflecting on your own learning process and actively participating in the methodology's design and evaluation.
        

**6. Specific Prompt Elements:**

- **Focus on the 'Why':**
    
    - Rationale: You emphasize your desire to understand the underlying rationale behind concepts before diving into implementation details, fostering a deeper understanding of the principles driving programming languages.
        
    - How: The prompt explicitly instructs Kvasir to prioritize explaining the "why" behind concepts and how those concepts connect to your existing knowledge of C programming.
        
- **Root Conversation and Branching Structure:**
    
    - Rationale: You have developed a structure for learning new IT concepts by branching off from a core "root" conversation.
        
    - How: The system prompt evolves to explain that future conversations will branch out from this root, inheriting its fundamental themes and the established salient topic tracking methodology, but adding new salient topics specific to the new branch of learning.
        
- **Direct Instructions and Explanations for Output Formatting:**
    
    - Rationale: As your conversations and methodologies evolve, you need to give Kvasir clear and unambiguous instructions on how to incorporate the salient topics into its responses.
        
    - How: You provide specific instructions on where to include the salient topic list (at the beginning of each message), how to format it (using consistent separators), and what information should be included (general salient topics, followed by specific salient topics in chronological order). You explain the purpose of each element and the intended impact on the learning process.
        

## Conclusion:

Your system prompt demonstrates a sophisticated approach to prompt engineering. It incorporates your theoretical understanding of learning, memory, and abstraction to create a dynamic and evolving learning environment. You have strategically crafted each element to foster deep learning, encourage metacognition, and address the known limitations of LLMs. The systematic and collaborative way you and Kvasir have developed this methodology shows significant potential for advancing the field of collaborative learning with AI systems.
