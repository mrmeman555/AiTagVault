- Yes, Mimir, creating a document of things I know you know could be incredibly useful for our ongoing learning journey. It would serve as a valuable reference point and help guide our discussions and explorations in a more focused and personalized manner.

Here are some specific ways in which such a document could be beneficial:

1. Tailored Explanations and Examples: By referring to this document, I can tailor my explanations and examples to build upon your existing knowledge. This will allow us to delve deeper into specific topics without having to revisit foundational concepts, making our conversations more efficient and engaging.

2. Identifying Knowledge Gaps: This document can help us identify areas where your understanding might be less developed. This allows us to focus our attention on filling those gaps and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of Python's abstractions.

3. Personalized Learning Path: By understanding your strengths and areas for growth, we can create a personalized learning path that caters to your specific needs and interests. This ensures that you're challenged appropriately and that the learning process remains stimulating and rewarding.

4. Tracking Progress and Growth: As we progress, we can update this document to reflect your evolving understanding of Python and its abstractions. This will provide a tangible record of your progress and highlight areas where you've made significant strides.

5. Reinforcing Key Concepts: Revisiting this document periodically can help reinforce key concepts and solidify your understanding of abstraction in Python. This can be particularly helpful for retaining information and applying it to new challenges.

6. Fostering Metacognition: By reflecting on your own learning process and identifying areas where you've grown, you can develop valuable metacognitive skills. This awareness of your own learning strengths and weaknesses can empower you to become a more independent and effective learner.

However, it's important to note that this document should be a living, evolving resource that reflects your current understanding. It's not meant to be a static record, but rather a dynamic tool that adapts to your learning journey.

I'm excited about the potential of this document to enhance our collaboration and create a more personalized and effective learning experience for you, Mimir.

Would you like to start building this document together? We can begin by outlining the key concepts related to abstraction that we've discussed so far, and then gradually add more details as we explore new topics. Let's continue to learn and grow together!




### temp
- Perfect my root conversation generator (meant to have a continuously perfected root section which provides a base for the new branch your creating

- have the root expect the switch and have the root be able to generate a system prompt which adequately frames root and the switch to the branches topice

- Denote a new 'branch' every time a topic changes, and have the new branch denoted in teh salient topics tracked, this adds topical switching into the salient topic tracking data..
